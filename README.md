# dotfiles

A collection of shell and application configs that I currently use, as well as useful aliases and scripts.

## Install
Execute the following commands in the terminal to run the installation script which will install and configure everything, prompting for options as it goes.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewDaws/dotfiles/master/scripts/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
